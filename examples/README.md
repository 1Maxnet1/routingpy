## Jupyter Notebook examples

We created a small collection of notebook examples to show the basic (and more advanced) usage of **routingpy**.

This collection is also available as out-of-the-box interactive notebooks on [mybinder.org](https://hub.mybinder.org/user/gis-ops-routing-py-lioibutx/tree/examples).
